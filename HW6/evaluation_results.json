We got a room with food and I paid for all of that with my credit card. They added a 20% \"service charge\" so I didn't tip anymore on top of that. I signed the credit card receipt and we moved to the bar to drink a little. I covered the cost for drinks for my sister as the party was for her. I paid with the same card, but on a different transaction and a different receipt. I took my copies and signed the restaurant's copies and thought that was the end of it. Well I just received the credit card statement for this month and the charges were on there, but there was an extra fifty dollars added on to the party bill and an extra 3 added to the drinks. I contacted the restaurant and they sent me a copy of the receipt that I signed and it was clearly not my handwriting. I emailed the copy that I kept in which there was no tip and what the total should be, in my handwriting that is clearly different. I'm waiting to hear from the General Manager of the restaurant, but I wanted to get as much info as I could before then. If they don't refund me, I'm going to dispute the charge, but as I said, I want all the info I can get here. \n\nThank you for reading!\n\nTL;DR:",

It has been 7 years since they dated but they have hooked up as recently as 3 years ago. He has been dating someone for the last 2 years. He lives across the country for school but still is close with her and they hang out whenever he is back. She has dated several people since.\n\nI have been friends with her for over 10 years, never anything more until recently. She just told me he is going to go ballistic when he hears about it, and that he still sends her intimate texts when he is in town.\n\n1. Did I screw up big time here? I obviously didn't plan this, it just happened. Is it fair for him to have a girlfriend and still hold on to this girl who is probably my best friend? \n\n2. How should we break the news? Her and I are both equally close with him, who should tell? She wants to, but I kind of want to as well...\n\nTL;DR:",

I'm wondering if when we talk about diversification, if that also means not having all my money with Vanguard funds -- here's how I'm exposed to Vanguard right now:\n\n* 401k --> 100% Vanguard Target Retirement\n* Roth IRA --> 80% VFIAX (Vanguard 500 Admiral) and 20% VGHCX (Healthcare fund)\n* Regular brokerage for savings (extra savings) --> 90% VFIAX and some individual stocks for nostalgic reasons (<10%)\n* 529 plan for kids --> Vanguard age-based option through my state's 529 manager\n\nMy employer luckily still offers a pension, which represents a bulk of my retirement savings and will be my primary source of retirement income.\n\nTL;DR:",

There are a bunch of annoying rules he's imposed post-me moving in, he's probably the stingiest person I've ever met, and he's decided that it's acceptable for the heat to be at 5ºC when no one's home, 10ºC when sleeping, and 15ºC when someone's home and awake (41, 50, and 59ºF, respectively) thus resulting in me being fucking freezing always. I checked the landlord tenant act, and it says it needs to be at least 20ºC (68ºF) from September through June. The most annoying part about it is that he goes about telling me the rules with a \"that's the way things are\" attitude, and like, I understand it's his house, but I'm paying rent, damnit. And a third of utilities.\n\nTL;DR:",

It's a rare occasion all of us are actually present at meals so it was a nice change, so I thought. My step-dad is a bit of a joker. The kind of joker who sometimes likes to go too far and make you feel awkward. \n  \nSo we were ordering our drinks and a cute waitress comes along. My step-dad tries to hint that I'm single, she's cute and I should put 2+2 together and make a move. I'm socially inept and awkward on most days but chatting to a girl in front of all my family? No chance. So my step-dad then comes into play and asks if she's single and if she thinks I'm attractive. She's blushing and smiles off actually answering the question. I then come out with, \"I'm not *that* desperate\". In my head I meant that I'm not desperate enough for my step-dad to hook me up, but it came out all wrong. Instead my family and the poor waitress thought I meant that I'm not desperate enough to chat her up. The girl looked mortified and depressed and I didn't even realize what I said until she had walked away and my family told me. For the rest of the meal this girl had to serve us and I felt completely ashamed and embarrassed. I wanted to apologize and tell her that's not what I meant but of course I'm still socially inept.\n\nTL;DR:",

No matter how long we are married, it's a set amount. There are also some things about waving rights to his will. \n\nTo me, that wasn't so bad - after all, he paid for it all. But, the lawyer said its not right. So, I go to him, and say the lawyer said certain elements are not fair or normal. He blows up. \n\nHe said I am \"Showing my true colors\" and being entitled. I tell him I don't even want more, but we should talk about certain elements ( like some kind of tiering if we are married over 10 years). \n\nNow he is so mad he wants to call off the wedding.
