# CMPSC_442

**CMPSC 442** is an Artificial Intelligence course offered at Pennsylvania State University. The course explores the fundamentals of AI, its historical development, core algorithms, and practical applications.

Throughout the semester, we studied key concepts such as:
- The history and evolution of Artificial Intelligence
- Types of Machine Learning models: Supervised and Unsupervised Learning
- The current trends in AI, including its integration with computer vision

## Projects

We applied core AI algorithms to classic problem-solving games.

### Project 1: Search Algorithms
We implemented **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** and **Depth-First Search (DFS)** to solve the following puzzles:
- N-Queens
- Lights Out
- Linear Disk Movement

To run the **Lights Out** game with a GUI, use the following command:

```bash
python lights_out_gui.py <rows> <cols>

### Project 2:
